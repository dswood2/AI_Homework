## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a series of projects that challenge you to apply various AI techniques to help Pac-Man navigate through his maze world, collect food efficiently, and outsmart those pesky ghosts. Each project focuses on different aspects of AI, including search algorithms, multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic inference.

## Project Overview

### Project 0: Warmup and Autograder
Get familiarized with the Pac-Man environment and learn how to control Pac-Man programmatically. Implement basic techniques to guide Pac-Man through the maze and collect food efficiently.

### Project 1: Search

Develop and apply general search algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A* Search to help Pac-Man find optimal paths through the maze.

### Project 2: Adversarial Search

Extend the Pac-Man environment to include multiple agents, both cooperative and competitive. Implement techniques like Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Expectimax to enable Pac-Man to make strategic decisions in the presence of adversarial ghosts.

### Project 3: MDP and Reinforcement Learning

Dive into the world of Reinforcement Learning and teach Pac-Man to learn from his experiences. Implement algorithms such as Q-Learning and Approximate Q-Learning to help Pac-Man adapt to dynamic maze environments and optimize his performance over time.

### Project 4: GhostBusters

Explore the realm of probabilistic inference and equip Pac-Man with the ability to track and predict the movements of ghosts. Implement techniques like Exact Inference, Approximate Inference, and Particle Filtering to help Pac-Man make informed decisions and stay one step ahead of his ghostly adversaries.
